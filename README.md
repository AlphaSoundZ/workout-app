This is an automatically synced Workout App. You can test it here:
https://alphasoundz.github.io/workout-app/
Click on one of the buttons to start a task. The buttons starting with ```1_``` have a duration of 30 seconds workout and 15 seconds break. The buttons starting with ```2_``` have a duration of 45 seconds workout and 15 seconds break. The 3D Models may take some time to load depending on the model size. Test the synchronization by opening the page on multiple devices. For correct synchronization click on the buttons starting with either ```1_``` or ```2_```. Page reload is not currently working with Github pages, so don't refresh the page after choosing a workout.
